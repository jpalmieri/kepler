              <b>CONCEPT</b><br />
              Kepler 452b is a fourteen-hour immersive event combining art, performance, installation, fashion, music and dance party. Using metaphor of space migration, out event will create a venue for envisioning possible futures - of openness, collective action, inclusion, self-expression and collective-individualism.
              <br /><br />
              Discovered by NASA in 2015, Kepler 452b is a potentially habitable super earth that is 1400 light years away. In order to transport people from the planet Earth to Kepler 452b, a surronding projection will simulate environments with visuals, videos and animations throughout the entire party. The night will be separated into three chapters, starting from Earth, entering space and navigating through star systems, and finally landing on Kepler 452b. Along with a line-up of DJs and live music, a series of performances will be carries out based on each theme. From desert to space to Kepler 452b. The overall surronding projections will include a series of video works that are selected from a variety of artists. Participants will become part of the installation and connect with each other through interactive immersive performances and the transformation of their own appearance.
              <br /><br />
              The leading musical characters will accompany the listener in a space race through different genres. Starting from earth's disintegration and chaos with the dark ambient artist Ancestral Voices, the ozone layer will be broken on Stefan Schneider's uplifting new live set. The gatekeeper of the cosmos, Vladimir Ivkovic, will ready the dancers for their ultimate mission among the starts. After a farewell to the galaxy on Valentino Mora's dub techno tonalities, Kepler 452b will slowly take shape with the gloomy fast paced sounds of MIIIA, Neel and Nuel.
