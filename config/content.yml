        The birth of Ancestral Voices represents a new path for an established and highly respected producer. Liam Blackburn carved out a singular musical voice as Indigo, and also more recently as half of acclaimed duo Akkord. Inevitably a new approach to creating music has developed into a new identity: seeping with textures, loaded with a taut energy that whispers tales of shamanism and transformative life experiences.

        Stripping back an already unique creative process proved a challenge that has paid off, and Blackburn’s evolving sound has no immediate sonic comparison. With distinct resonances of his musical heritage flowing through a more mature filter, there is a mystical atmosphere that resounds through his debut LP as you hear Ancestral Voices emerge triumphantly into the world. The Ancestral Voices debut LP is an insight into a subconscious journey; fully formed as one accomplished ‘Night Of Visions’.

        Chinese Canadian electronic music artist MIIIA has been weaving her unique blend of vibes at the forefront of Shanghai’s underground music scene since she settled down in this city. With a relentless passion for creation, she is continuously building a musical dream-world that grows from the studio into her on-stage performances. Countless party-goers have fallen for her talent and charisma; she is truly a part of China’s current underground music movement.

        After being exposed to rave culture in Canada, MIIIA’s Shanghai journey began with a weekly radio session at uDance (the first 24hr underground music radio station in China). Her weekly live show ‘Tripout Session’ was ranked no.1 for the station, and for this she was invited to perform at the opening of the 1st International Radio Music Festival in Zurich. It was the beginning of an expansion out of her local scene: since then MIIIA has performed in Spain, Germany, Canada, Korea, Hong Kong, Taipei, and numerous cities in mainland China.

His considered output fuses rhythm and texture with techno and ambience in hugely captivating ways, as proved by his latest LP Phobos, which was well received by all media and set a new standard for ambient music.
        Further releases on labels like Bunker NY and Spectrum Spools only confirm the uniqueness of his sound, and that also comes across in his immersive ambient AV shows at places like Mutek and Berlin Atonal, his solo live techno shows and of course Voices From the Lake, his live and studio collaboration with Donato Dozzy. Neel is, then, a true modern day techno craftsman who can do surreal and unusual things with sound in truly unique ways.

        Seamlessly incorporating influences of movement, expression and soul into his production, Valentino Canzani Mora has never strayed far from this ethos since experimenting with music from a very young age. Raised by Uruguayan parents - of which his father was a trained sound engineer and musician, Mora was surrounded by music and exposed to producing constantly throughout his childhood.

        Before shifting back to his given name, Mora had a string of releases including one LP under his French Fries moniker, during which time he co-curated Clekclekboom recordings, as well as handled artistic direction for the label. Since then he has shifted his attention to his own label ‘IDO’ - or - Intercontinental Dance Organization, with co-founder Amila. Drawing inspiration from the early house scene IDO centres around melting percussion, breaks and techno into a rhythmic migration of hypnotic soundscapes. Furthermore, IDO is Mora’s outlet for demonstrating his explorations of sound that he has discovered between his travels of Tokyo and since relocating to Berlin.

        Embarrassment is a key point on the border between the conscious and the unconscious and between oneself and the other. Embarrassment is a door that a person keeps closed before others, and that is sometimes even closed to himself. We can open that door to discover another side to our human experiences. Embarrassed Years takes a nonjudgmental look at our most intimate moments, our internal, physical underground, the experiences and actions we conceal from others. By repressing these human experiences, we put up borders between ourselves, our bodies and others.

        ESOC is an imprecise group, they learn from each other, understand themselves without explanation, by creating live, together and at a time. Any de nition of ESOC will be correct but it will also be incomplete because ESOC will survive itself: ESOC is mine, yours, theirs and ours.

        ESOC owns an unknown discourse of its own, however familiar. With ESOC music is conceived and treated as energy, it is music without restraint: simple to understand but dif cult to appreciate. And the choreography is the other chaos, which drags you to a pleasant renunciation of the explained and explainable, because nothing is coordinated and the impossible story of reality is shown and also happens again. The result is a kind of overcoming and bizarre happening that the passive spectator can only depart, so in front of ESOC do not offer resistance or seek answers outside of you: participate and have fun. The anonymity is real.
