        The birth of Ancestral Voices represents a new path for an already established and highly respected producer. Liam Blackburn carved out a singular musical voice as Indigo, and also more recently as half of the acclaimed duo Akkord. Inevitably, the new approach to creating music has developed a new identity: seeping with textures, loaded with a taut energy that whispers tales of shamanism and transformative life experiences.

        Stripping back an already unique creative process proved a challenge that has paid off, and Blackburn’s evolving sound has no immediate sonic comparison. With distinct resonances of his musical heritage flowing through a more mature filter, there is a mystical atmosphere that resounds throughout his debut LP as Ancestral Voices and can be heard emerging triumphantly into the world. The Ancestral Voices debut LP is an insight into a subconscious journey: fully formed as one accomplished ‘Night Of Visions’.

        Chinese Canadian electronic music artist MIIIA has been weaving her unique blend of vibes at the forefront of Shanghai’s underground music scene since she settled down in the city. With a relentless passion for creation, she continuously builds a musical dream-world that vibrates from the studio into her on-stage performances. Countless party-goers have fallen for her talent and charisma; she is truly a part of China’s current underground music movement.

        After being exposed to rave culture in Canada, MIIIA began her Shanghai journey with a weekly radio session at uDance (the first 24hr underground music radio station in China). Her weekly live show ‘Tripout Session’ was ranked no.1 for the station, and for this she was invited to perform at the opening of the 1st International Radio Music Festival in Zurich. It was the beginning of an expansion out of her local scene: since then MIIIA has performed in Spain, Germany, Canada, Korea, Hong Kong, Taipei, and numerous cities in mainland China.

        Neel is an artist who pays close attention to the technical aspect of sound, whether producing in the studio, DJing or playing live around the world. His carefully considered output fuses rhythm and texture with techno and ambience in massively captivating ways, as demonstrated by his latest LP Phobos, which was well received by all media and set a new standard for ambient music.

        Further releases on labels like Bunker NY and Spectrum Spools only confirm the uniqueness of his sound, something that also comes across in his immersive ambient AV shows at places like Mutek and Berlin Atonal--his solo live techno shows--and, of course, Voices From the Lake, his live and studio collaboration with Donato Dozzy. Neel is, therefore, a true modern-day techno craftsman who can do surreal and unusual things with sound in truly unique ways.

        Seamlessly incorporating influences of movement, expression and soul into his production, Valentino Canzani Mora has never strayed far from this ethos since beginning to experiment with music at a very young age. Raised by Uruguayan parents--of which his father was a trained sound engineer and musician--Mora was constantly surrounded by music and exposed to the music production industry throughout his childhood.

        Before shifting back to his given name, Mora had a string of releases including one LP under his French Fries moniker, during which time he co-curated Clekclekboom recordings, as well as taking on artistic direction for the label. Since then he has shifted his attention to his own label ‘IDO’ - or - Intercontinental Dance Organization, with co-founder Amila. Drawing inspiration from the early house scene, IDO centers around melting percussion, breaks and techno into a rhythmic migration of hypnotic soundscapes. Furthermore, IDO is Mora’s outlet for demonstrating the explorations of sound that he has experimented with between his travels in Tokyo and since relocating to Berlin.

        Embarrassment is a key point on the border between the conscious and the unconscious and between oneself and the other. Embarrassment is a door that a person keeps closed before others, and that is sometimes even closed to themselves. We can open that door to discover another side of our human experiences. Embarrassed Years takes a nonjudgmental look at our most intimate moments, our internal, physical underground, the experiences and actions we conceal from others. By repressing these human experiences, we put up borders between ourselves, our bodies and others.

From event to event, the cast, title and scenes produced by the group change according to the venue. The show that ensues is constructed with different scenes that address sexuality, the digital age, fetishes, contemporary dance, pop and youth culture. The scenes are often constructed through structured improvisation with a prepared aesthetic approach that aims to create an entertaining spectacle.

        YBDG is a critique of the institutionalized performances and dance shows produced by theaters; the group’s performances are sometimes prepared within one day, quickly built up and publicized, but no less vivid for it.  In this respect, all participants influence the creation of the scenes that follow, and carry the same degree of authorship. YBDG has shown, amongst others, at: Silencio, Paris, Lithuanian Pavilion, Venice Biennale 2015, Chart Art Fair, Manifesta Biennale, Zürich, AHMD & Chapter 10, London, Lofficialàrt, Paris, Roskilde Festival, DK."

        Bodies that Shatter is a collection by Xvii Studio that explores the contemporary phenomenon of ‘net feminism’ or Feminism 4.0 which conceives female melancholy as a methodological practice, that questions and thwarts society’s patriarchal structures. The title ‘Bodies that Shatter’ refers to Judith Butler’s book ‘Bodies that Matter’. Butler describes the performative power of language, where subjects are described as male or female, and thus become socially perceptible as such through the performativity of the gender. The core of the collection appeals to the power of female self-portrayal in the sense of empowerment as opposed to the traditional male-dominated perspective.
