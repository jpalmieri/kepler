bio: |
  Nelson Santos is a Portuguese fashion designer, illustrator and artist, who explores and overemphasizes the human body shape by manipulating materials, texture and cuts to create unique pieces to suit each individual he works with. His work is a fusion of art and fashion that explores a different side of fashion, the dichotomy between the beautiful and the ugly and the aspirational desire for beauty. Nelsonâ€™s inspiration comes from the people in the streets, music and films.
