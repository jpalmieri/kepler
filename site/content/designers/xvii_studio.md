  Bodies that Shatter is a collection by Xvii Studio that explores the contemporary phenomenon of ‘net feminism’ or Feminism 4.0 which conceives female melancholy as a methodological practice, that questions and thwarts society’s patriarchal structures. The title ‘Bodies that Shatter’ refers to Judith Butler’s book ‘Bodies that Matter’. Butler describes the performative power of language, where subjects are described as male or female, and thus become socially perceptible as such through the performativity of the gender. The core of the collection appeals to the power of female self-portrayal in the sense of empowerment as opposed to the traditional male-dominated perspective.
