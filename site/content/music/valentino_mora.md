bio: |
  Seamlessly incorporating influences of movement, expression and soul into his production, Valentino Canzani Mora has never strayed far from this ethos since beginning to experiment with music at a very young age. Raised by Uruguayan parents--of which his father was a trained sound engineer and musician--Mora was constantly surrounded by music and exposed to the music production industry throughout his childhood.

  Before shifting back to his given name, Mora had a string of releases including one LP under his French Fries moniker, during which time he co-curated Clekclekboom recordings, as well as taking on artistic direction for the label. Since then he has shifted his attention to his own label ‘IDO’ - or - Intercontinental Dance Organization, with co-founder Amila. Drawing inspiration from the early house scene, IDO centers around melting percussion, breaks and techno into a rhythmic migration of hypnotic soundscapes. Furthermore, IDO is Mora’s outlet for demonstrating the explorations of sound that he has experimented with between his travels in Tokyo and since relocating to Berlin.
