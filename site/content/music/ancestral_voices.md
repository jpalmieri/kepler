bio: |
  The birth of Ancestral Voices represents a new path for an already established and highly respected producer. Liam Blackburn carved out a singular musical voice as Indigo, and also more recently as half of the acclaimed duo Akkord. Inevitably, the new approach to creating music has developed a new identity: seeping with textures, loaded with a taut energy that whispers tales of shamanism and transformative life experiences.
  Stripping back an already unique creative process proved a challenge that has paid off, and Blackburn’s evolving sound has no immediate sonic comparison. With distinct resonances of his musical heritage flowing through a more mature filter, there is a mystical atmosphere that resounds throughout his debut LP as Ancestral Voices and can be heard emerging triumphantly into the world. The Ancestral Voices debut LP is an insight into a subconscious journey: fully formed as one accomplished ‘Night Of Visions’.
