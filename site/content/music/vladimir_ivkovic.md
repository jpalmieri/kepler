bio: |
  Born and raised in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Ivkovic witnessed the peak of alternative culture and disintegration of normative society during his formative years. He moved to Germany in the beginning of the 90’s, and in the late 90’s to early 2000’s invited artists like Carlos Souffront, I-F. I-G, Marco Passarani, and Serge (amongst others) to play Selected and Substance events. Ivkovic is a longtime resident at the infamous Salon des Amateurs in Düsseldorf and the man behind Offen Music, a label specialized in authentic subjectivism. One of the finest selectors of hidden musical gems, he gleans from the most cloistered sonic lagoons – expect to see Loch Ness’s dragon dancing on the floor.
