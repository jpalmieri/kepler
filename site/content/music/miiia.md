bio: |
  Chinese Canadian electronic music artist MIIIA has been weaving her unique blend of vibes at the forefront of Shanghai’s underground music scene since she settled down in the city. With a relentless passion for creation, she continuously builds a musical dream-world that vibrates from the studio into her on-stage performances. Countless party-goers have fallen for her talent and charisma; she is truly a part of China’s current underground music movement.

  After being exposed to rave culture in Canada, MIIIA began her Shanghai journey with a weekly radio session at uDance (the first 24hr underground music radio station in China). Her weekly live show ‘Tripout Session’ was ranked no.1 for the station, and for this she was invited to perform at the opening of the 1st International Radio Music Festival in Zurich. It was the beginning of an expansion out of her local scene: since then MIIIA has performed in Spain, Germany, Canada, Korea, Hong Kong, Taipei, and numerous cities in mainland China.
