bio: |
  Neel is an artist who pays close attention to the technical aspect of sound, whether producing in the studio, DJing or playing live around the world. His carefully considered output fuses rhythm and texture with techno and ambience in massively captivating ways, as demonstrated by his latest LP Phobos, which was well received by all media and set a new standard for ambient music.

  Further releases on labels like Bunker NY and Spectrum Spools only confirm the uniqueness of his sound, something that also comes across in his immersive ambient AV shows at places like Mutek and Berlin Atonal--his solo live techno shows--and, of course, Voices From the Lake, his live and studio collaboration with Donato Dozzy. Neel is, therefore, a true modern-day techno craftsman who can do surreal and unusual things with sound in truly unique ways.
