  Embarrassment is a key point on the border between the conscious and the unconscious and between oneself and the other. Embarrassment is a door that a person keeps closed before others, and that is sometimes even closed to themselves. We can open that door to discover another side of our human experiences. Embarrassed Years takes a nonjudgmental look at our most intimate moments, our internal, physical underground, the experiences and actions we conceal from others. By repressing these human experiences, we put up borders between ourselves, our bodies and others.
