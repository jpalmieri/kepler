bio: |
  Young Boy Dancing Group is a loose performance collective that includes the likes of Tomislav Feller, Nils Amadeus Lange, Maria Metsalu, Ofelia jarl Ortega, Vincent Riebeek, Nicolas Roses, and Manuel Scheiwiller. From event to event, the cast, title and scenes produced by the group change according to the venue. The show that ensues is constructed with different scenes that address sexuality, the digital age, fetishes, contemporary dance, pop and youth culture. The scenes are often constructed through structured improvisation with a prepared aesthetic approach that aims to create an entertaining spectacle.

  YBDG is a critique of the institutionalized performances and dance shows produced by theaters; the group’s performances are sometimes prepared within one day, quickly built up and publicized, but no less vivid for it. In this respect, all participants influence the creation of the scenes that follow, and carry the same degree of authorship. YBDG has shown, amongst others, at: Silencio, Paris, Lithuanian Pavilion, Venice Biennale 2015, Chart Art Fair, Manifesta Biennale, Zürich, AHMD & Chapter 10, London, Lofficialàrt, Paris, Roskilde Festival, DK."
