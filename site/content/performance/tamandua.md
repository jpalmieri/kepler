bio: |
  Tamandua is a Swedish-born rope artist based in Berlin. Their imagery and performance are deeply interwoven with their passion for kinbaku - the Japan-originated art of rope bondage. They teach the practice as a profession, treating it as more than a casual interest or a skill. Rather the relation to the practice and to rope as a material becomes the primary tool of choice with which to navigate the world and life in general on a creative and emotional level.
