bio: |
  Mikey is a songwriter and performer born in Newcastle Australia now based in Berlin by way of New York and London. He has won a place in a strikingly high number of human hearts for both his music and his iconic nightlife fashions, both of which travel into uncharted territories of gender and sexuality. His songs address unconditional states such as energetic connections on the dancefloor, annihilation in love or deep and vulnerable conversation. Throughout his music, there is an intense longing to be able to connect beyond identity, beyond body and beyond fear. He is not positioning himself inside of anyone's storyline, but giving flesh to that space where we are no one and all.
