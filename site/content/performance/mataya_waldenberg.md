bio: |
  Mataya Waldenberg, born in 1994, is an artist and musician based in Vienna. Having studied Experimental Art at the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz since 2012, they focus their pieces mainly on life in between worlds. Their own body is their main medium â€“ roaming in between male and female, the real and the fantastic.

  Along with their visual, physical presence, music is Mataya's most important method of expression. All lyrics, compositions and synthesizers are of their own making, and are sometimes the product of collaboration with related souls. Their album 'LOVING ANGEL PROTOTYPE', to be released this fall, consists of ten tracks depicting raw emotion, overcoming challenges and the search for a place in the world.
