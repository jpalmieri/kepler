  Proxima Plus is a dance collective directed by Claire Côte, Irene Anglada and Marissa Medal, whose aim is to bring people closer by connecting and exchanging energy, and to experience movement and sensations more fully through interactive performances. Proxima Plus will prepare and guide the “lucky ones” on their journey to Kepler 425b, accompanied by the juicy waves of ZAFTIK musik.
