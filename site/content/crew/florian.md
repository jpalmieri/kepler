  A soon-to-be graduate of Universität der Künste Berlin,, Fashion designer Florian Máthé is currently developing a collection that is deeply influenced by London’s Queer Performance Scene. With a desire to “[question] the terms of beauty, body and aesthetics”, he wishes to convey vibrantness, freedom and emotion in the context of fashion as well as a new spectacular performance. Florian Máthé founded and organised pop up project and art space “je regrette” in Berlin Mitte, curating four shows featuring artists such as Mischa Badasyan, Daniel Ferstl, Stephanie Ballantine and Kim Asendorf.
