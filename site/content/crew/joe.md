  Joe Palmieri is a Software Engineer based in Oakland, California who devotes his energy to collaborative installations in the San Francisco area and beyond. He has contributed to Catacomb of Veils and, to a lesser extent, La Victrola, both shown at Burning Man 2016. Recently, he has led the conceptual and preliminary design for C60, a steel sculpture with interactive fire effects which will debut in a partially finished form at Burning Man 2017. Over the coming year, he will be adding additional fire effects to C60 and sculpting his mustache to more Dal√≠-like proportions.
