bio: >
  Mingling her interest for electronic music and writing since her early teens, the experiences within editorial contexts (Tsinoshi Bar, Inverted Audio) and festivals (NeXTones, Krake) brought Vittoria to move from Milano to Berlin in 2015, two weeks after her graduation in International Relations. Fuelled by a grounded enthusiasm and strong will, she started an internship at Matias Aguayo’s label Cómeme to then soon become a booker of the label’s related agency futura. Concurrently working remotely for Electropark Exchanges, a Milano-based project of seated concerts focusing on electronic and classical music, Vittoria is now also collaborating with the experimental and sustainable festival Terraforma.
