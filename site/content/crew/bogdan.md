bio: >
  Bogdan Licar is a monkey-coder, filmmaker and avid dancer. After years of working with mathematics and digital art, he moved to analogue photography and filmmaking, focusing on deprecated visual and printing techniques, with the occasional scripted short film for his ongoing filmmaking degree in London. Mainly interested in water and plants, he tries to merge dance, shadow play and childhood memories onto film and possibly into physical ascension.
