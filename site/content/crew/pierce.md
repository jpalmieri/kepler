bio: |
  Pierce Jordan is an experienced artist and designer based in Vancouver, British Columbia. As a developed graphic and industrial designer, he is driven by moments of engagement between people, products and brands, and the emotions, memories and ideas that create these moments.
  At the forefront of his artistic practice lies the simple but often overlooked foundations of beauty and experience; the serendipity of losing oneself to an experience, or the overwhelming emotional response elicited by beauty.
  He taps into these rare but pure moments by making work that engages with the people who view it, in a time and site specific setting.
