  Originally born in China, Ma Li received her MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute. She formulates dreamlike worlds using recycled materials both physical and digital. Combining her background in choreography and her upbringing in China, Ma Li orchestrates participatory performance through the methodologies of military training and childhood play. Ma Li is the recipient of a Pollack-Krasner Foundation Grant, the Murphy and Cadogan Contemporary Art Award, and has performed and exhibited internationally at art museums, galleries and venues. Her latest project was presented at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco in Feb 2017, where she led 300 visitors to play a gigantic dance video game of watermelon-style TechnoTaichi.
